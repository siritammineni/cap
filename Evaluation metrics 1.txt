Task-Specific Evaluation Metrics for Language Models

1.Automated Evaluation metrics(Without human intervention)

  a. Perplexity:
     Given a model and an input text sequence, perplexity measures how likely the model is to generate the input text sequence. As a metric, it can be used to evaluate how well the model has learned the distribution of the text it was trained on.This metric outputs a dictionary with the perplexity scores for the text input in the list, and the average perplexity. If one of the input texts is longer than the max input length of the model, then it is truncated to the max length for the perplexity computation.
     Ways to calculate:
        1. Using hugging face transformers https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity
        2. Using custom LLM(trained from scratch)
        3. Using Natural Language Toolkit

  b. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) - Mainly for Machine translation
         It is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine’s output and that of a human: “the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is” – this is the central idea behind BLEU.
      BLEU’s output is always a number between 0 and 1. This value indicates how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts.
     Ways to calculate:
          1.Using hugging face evaluate library https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu
          2.Using Natural language toolkit  (python)
          3.Using SacreBLEU
   
   c. ROUGE (Recall oriented understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
         ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics and a software package used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in natural language processing. It is used for evaluating text summarization and chatbot responses. It measures recall, precision, and F1-score  based on overlapping n-grams, LCS, and skip bigram matches.           
       Ways to calculate:
          1.Using hugging face evaluate library https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge          
          2.Using Natural language toolkit  (python)
          3.Using Sumeval library (supports all ROUGE types)
          4.Using rouge-score library (Google's implementation)

   d. METOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)
            It is a semantic aware evaluation metric, it considers synonyms, steaming(running=run),exact matches and word order. It is useful for chatbots because it better reflects human like understanding
       Ways to calculate:
           1. Using hugging face evaluate library https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/metor
           2. Using Natural language toolkit
   e. F1 Score
   f. Accuracy


NOTE:  Combine ROUGE+BLEU+METOR to evaluate the model.

Technical Specific Evaluation Metrics of model :

1. Latency : refers to the time taken for model to process an input
        Tools : tensorflow profiler, pytorch profiler, promethus + Grafana
2. Token Usage : Number of tokens processed or generated by the model
        Tools : Hugging face tokenizer, GPT tokenizer
3. Throughput : how many tokens the model can generate per unit of time
        Tools : Use benchmarks like MLPerf
4. Memory Usage : amount of memory used by model during inference and training
        Tools : Use tools like nvidia-smi and python libraries like psutil
5. Inference time
        Tools : tensorflow profiler, pytorch profiler, promethus + Grafana
